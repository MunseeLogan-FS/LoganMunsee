          &emsp;I'm a U.S. Air Force veteran and freelance web developer with a passion for building modern, responsive websites that are as functional as they are visually appealing. I specialize in front-end development using HTML, CSS, React, and design frameworks like Chakra UI. Over the past few years, I’ve built websites for small businesses, helping them establish and grow their online presence through clean code, mobile-first design, and practical solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Currently, I am pursuing my degree in Web Development from Full Sail University, I'm sharpening my skills in server-side technologies and full-stack development. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, learning new frameworks, and seeing projects through from concept to deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Whether it’s creating a polished portfolio, building a custom site from scratch, or solving layout headaches, I bring professionalism, creativity, and a user-first mindset to every project. My goal is to help clients and teams deliver experiences that work seamlessly—on any device, for any user.

              Learning web development has been a hobby of mine even before I
              started at Full Sail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making a website for my dad was actually how I got into web design
              as a hobby 9 years ago. Though I have not been very consistent in
              keeping up with my skills.
